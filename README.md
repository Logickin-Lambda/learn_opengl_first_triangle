# Didn't you started a vulkan repo?
Well, Vulkan is too hard to begin with because there are so many initial setup, while I have no idea anything about graphical programming; thus, I decided to take a step back by learning OpenGL first, to understand the pipline and the basic components of it. Hopefully, I can able to understand a part of the api, well enough for me to transit to vulkan in the future.

Besides, I am not a fan of cmake, while I love zig; thus, I decided to make an attempt to render a triangle with [Zigglgen](https://github.com/castholm/zigglgen) and [zglfw](https://github.com/zig-gamedev/zglfw). Once I have a working program, I will refactor the code such that it will be easier to understand which part of the code response to which part of the pipline for future reference.
